## About SafiriDB

safiriDB is an open-source Laravel 10 powered database management platform designed to simplify how developers and system administrators work with multiple database engines.
The name “Safiri” means gift in Travel — and this project is built to be exactly that: a useful, reliable, and free gift to the developer community.

safiriDB provides an elegant, unified interface for managing MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases across environments. With just a few clicks or CLI commands, you can:

- 🚀 Start and stop database instances
- 📡 Monitor real-time statuses
- 🔔 Receive notifications on state changes
- 🛡 Use a secure, Laravel-driven architecture
- 🔌 Extend the platform easily thanks to clean code and modular design

Whether you’re managing local dev databases, staging instances, or simply want a centralized dashboard for your projects, safariiDB offers a lightweight, modern, and intuitive approach to database operations.

## ✨ Why I Built This

As a backend engineer and DevOps enthusiast, I often juggle multiple environments and database engines. Traditional tools felt bloated, fragmented, or overly complex for simple workflows.

So I created safiriDB — a minimal, extensible, developer-friendly solution built with Laravel, designed especially for teams and individuals who want clarity, automation, and better control.
